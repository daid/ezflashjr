These are the dumped first stage boot roms of the EZ Flash Jr.
The first stage loads the 2nd stage loader (which provides file selection) from the SD card.

These ROMs are somehow updated by the firmware updater, exact mechanism is currently unknown.

Only the first 32KB is dumped. It is currently unknown of the first stage boot rom uses an MBC.
